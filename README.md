# redux-saga-starter
`npm install`

This is the starting repo to accompany [12-03c-redux-saga-setup.md](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/curriculum-syllabus-master/blob/develop/curriculum-content/week-12-sql-advanced-redux-sagas/12-03c-redux-saga-setup.md)

This is a 3/4 stack app (no DB)
`npm run client` and `npm run server`

Users can input an element on the DOM, hit the submit button. The entry gets saved in an array on the server.

This is using just React-Redux as written. Lecture converts it to use Redux-Saga for the async GET and POST calls.

Point of lecture is to show setup of redux-saga.
